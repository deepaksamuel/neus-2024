## **Geant4 compilation**
- Preferred OS: Ubuntu
  https://geant4.web.cern.ch/download/11.2.1.html
- Need to download both source codes (500 MB) and datasets (2 GB)
- Compile them 
- *Warning:* Install Anaconda only after installation of Geant4
- Instructions for installation of other software can also be found at 
https://github.com/deepaksamuel/ehep-2023
---
## **Helper script to install required software**

- I have written a script which will download all requirements and install dependencies. The script named `neus.sh` is found in this repository, you can download it on your Desktop:

> https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepaksamuel/neus-2024/master/neus.sh

- Right click and save link as `neus.sh` on your Desktop

- Once saved, on your terminal execute the command source neus.sh

- Please note that this script will also download the Geant4 datasets which may be extremely time consuming. However, as soon as the datasets downloading begins, parallely you can compile other codes.

- Do not close the terminal in which the `neus.sh `script is running. Open a new terminal for parallely compiling the other programmes.


---


## **Folder structure**

For the sake of this school, I propose to use this folder structure (automatically done by the helper script):
- Create a main directory called `neus`, preferably on the Desktop
- Inside of `neus`, create three directories (along with the subdirectories as shown below
  - `downloads`
  - `g4`
    - `build`
    - `install`
    - `data`   
  - `root`
    - `build`
    - `install`

## Instructions for installing ROOT
### Invoking CMake-GUI

Most often, softwares used in HEP are distributed as source codes than binaries. In such a case, you will have to use CMake to generate your build files and then compile your code to generate the binary.
There is a command line way to work with CMake but just to make things easier, we will use the cmake gui.
You can call the gui by typing ```cmake3-gui``` on the terminal.

---

![Alt text](img/cmake-root.png "a title")

---

The first three steps are generic whenever you compile from sources (you will do the same for Geant4 as well).
  1. Choosing the location where your source code resides: The easy download script places the source code in the root folder
  2. Choosing the location for your build files: The build folder inside root folder is used for this purpose
  3. Choosing the location for your install files: The install folder inside root folder is used for this purpose

The fourth step is where you choose additional options for your root installation. If you scroll down you will see options like ```pyroot``` and ```roofit``` which you should enable as they will be used in the school. 

---
### Important:
It is often the case that the python installed by Anaconda distribution conflicts with your many other python distributions on your computer. If you want your ROOT to be compiled with the python from Anaconda distribution, you may have to set the CMake variable appropriately. For example, I have set ```CMAKE_INSTALL_PYTHONDIR``` to ```/home/samuel/anaconda3/bin/python```.

---

The fifth step is clicking on the ```configure``` button which leads you to another popup asking you to choose the compiler and so on. The default option is ```use default native compilers``` with ```Unix Makefiles``` in the dropdown. Unless you know what you are doing, accept the defaults. If you see no erros reported in the log, you can go on to the next step. In case of errors, you may have to install additional dependencies reported therein. 

The final step is clicking on the ```Generate``` button. Once again, you may have to check for any errors reported at this stage.

---

### Using CMake command line
If you want know how to invoke cmake steps that you did in the earlier step using GUI, using the command line, here it is:
First cd to the build folder inside root directory:

  - ```cd neus/root/build```
and then
- ```cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../root-6.28.06/ -Dpyroot=ON -Drootfit=ON -DPython3_EXECUTABLE=/home/codespace/anaconda3/bin/python```

Note that the above step has to be done only if you are not using the Cmake-Gui. 

---

### Compiling the code
Now that the build files are created, you are now ready to compile your code.

- On a terminal window, cd to ```build``` folder inside ```neus/root```

- type ```make -j4``` to begin compiling

- wait for 30 - 45 minutes
  
- If the compiling is successful, type ```make install```  

---

### Running ROOT
If everything is done, you should be able to run ROOT. For this, on a terminal cd to  ```neus/root/install/bin``` and type:

```source thisroot.sh```

Then type, 

```root```

You should see the ROOT command prompt coming up.

---

![Alt text](img/root-prompt.png "a title")

---

You must source `thisroot.sh` every time you open a new terminal. In case you intend to use ROOT frequently, this may be inconvenient. You should instead add this line to your bash.rc file.

---

### Other ways to install / run ROOT

## Instructions for installing Geant4
### Invoking CMake-GUI
We will follow the same instructions as used for root installation
Call ```cmake3-gui``` on the terminal.

---

![Alt text](img/cmake-geant4.png "a title")

---

The steps are as follows:
  1. Set the source location
  2. Set the location for your build files: The build folder inside g4 folder is used for this purpose
  3. Set the location  for your install files: The install folder inside g4 folder is used for this purpose
  4. Set the location for the data files: The data folder inside g4 folder is used for this purpose

---


The fifth step is where you choose additional options for your Geant4 installation. Please make sure that the following options are checked:
- GEANT4_BUILD_MULTITHREADED
- GEANT4_USE_GDML
- GEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11
- GEANT4_USE_QT

IMPORTANT: Please uncheck the ```GEANT4_INSTALL_DATA``` or else the datasets will be automatically downloaded again

---
The sixth step is clicking on the ```configure``` button which leads you to another popup asking you to choose the compiler and so on.  The default option is ```use default native compilers``` with ```Unix Makefiles``` in the dropdown. Unless you know what you are doing, accept the defaults. If you see no erros reported in the log, you can go on to the next step. In case of errors, you may have to install additional dependencies reported therein. 

The sevent step is clicking on the ```Generate``` button. Once again, you may have to check for any errors reported at this stage.

---

### **Compiling the code**
Now that the build files are created, you are now ready to compile your code.

- On a terminal window, cd to ```build``` folder inside ```ehep/g4```

- type ```make -j4``` to begin compiling

- wait for 45 - 60 minutes
  
- If the compiling is successful, type ```make install```  

---

### **Compiling without CMake**

  ```cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../install ../geant4-v11.1.2/ -DGEANT4_USE_GDML=ON -DGEANT4_INSTALL_DATADIR=../data -DGEANT4_USE_OPENGL_X11=ON -DGEANT4_USE_QT=ON```

  ```make -j4```

---

### Setting the Geant4 environment
Every time you run a Geant4 code, you must source this script ```geant4.sh``` will is found in the ```neus/g4/install/bin folder```

- ```source neus/g4/install/bin/geant4.sh```

failing which, you will not be able to compile the code successfully. If you are frequently developing Geant4 code, it is best to source this in your .bashrc file.
